# Download GitHub Release Asset

This action downloads an asset from a Github release. Supports private repositories as well as monorepos with path prefixes to their tags, i.e. `lib/log/v` will only match releases with that prefix.

Created by the [official GitHub template](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action).

## Inputs

### `repo`

The 'owner/repo' of the repository to download from, i.e. `soukvm/test`

### `version`

The version of the release to download from (defaults to `latest`)

### `prefix`

The tag prefix to use, useful in monorepos with path prefix for tags (defaults to `v`)

### `file`

**Required** The name of the file in the release to download. If it starts and ends with `/`, it will be treated as regex. (e.g `/[a-zA-Z]+.txt/`)

### `out`

The directory where the file will be stored on local disk (defaults to `${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}` or CWD)

### `mode`

The mode of the file after downloading it from the release (defaults to `644`)

### `token`
An optional Access Token to access repository. You need to either specify this or use the ``secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`` environment variable. Note that if you are working with a private repository, you cannot use the default ``secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`` - you have to set up a [personal access token with at least the scope org:hook](https://github.com/dsaltares/fetch-gh-release-asset/issues/10#issuecomment-668665447).

### `unpack`

Unpack the asset if it's of type .tar.gz, .tgz or .zip (defaults to `false`)

## Outputs

### `out`

The location on local disk where the file was stored (i.e. `/tmp/foo-file.txt`)

### `version`

The version of the release or tag (i.e. `1.0.1` *without prefix*)

### `browser_download_url`

The URL of the downloaded asset
